# ASCIIGame
A small ascii adventure game written in python and ncurses. It takes only a couple minutes to complete. I created the game in about 3 days as part of a Programming 110 school assignment. I do not plan on continuing it any time in the near future, though I can list *many* ways it can be improved.

# Dialog Creator
This was created as a school assignment as well. It was meant to go along with the game as a tool for creating dialog (hence why I have packaged them together). It functions as a tool for creating dialog for the game, but the game does not accept the files it outputs. It's more a proof of concept. If I do more work the ASCII game in the future this will be the functionality I add.
